 ## 📸 Python Image Slideshow Creator
A dynamic, high-resolution image slideshow application built with Python, Tkinter, and the Pillow (PIL) library. This tool automates the process of resizing and cycling through a collection of images in a clean GUI window.

## 🚀 Features
* Automatic Resizing: Automatically scales all input images to a standard 1080x1080 resolution for consistency.

* Smart Cycling: Utilizes itertools.cycle to prepare for infinite looping through the image list.

* Pillow Integration: Uses advanced image handling to support multiple formats like .jpg and .png.

* Interactive Controls: Includes a "Start Slideshow" button to trigger the sequence.

* Smooth Transitions: Built-in delay using the time module to control the pace of the show.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
You will need to install the Pillow library to handle image processing:
pip install Pillow

## 📋 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.

2. Update the image_path list in the code with the actual file paths from your computer.

3. Run the script:
python slideshow.py

4. Click "Start Slideshow" to begin the sequence.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
* Image Processing: Implemented list comprehension to efficiently open and resize all images at once:
images = [Image.open(path).resize(image_size) for path in image_path]

* GUI Label Updates: Uses label.config() and label.update() to refresh the UI in real-time during the loop.

* Path Handling: Employs Raw Strings (r"path") to ensure Windows backslashes don't cause escape character errors.
